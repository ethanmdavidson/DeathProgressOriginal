Having trouble with motivation? This live wallpaper will give you a little kick in the pants by displaying what percentage of your life has already been wasted. Or, if you'd like to take the optimistic view, you can think of it as a loading bar for the sweet release of death. Either way, put in your birth date and set it as your wallpaper. Pretty soon, you'll be more aware of your creeping mortality than ever before. Watch in existential dread as the black (or any other cheerful color you'd like) slowly fills your screen with nothingness.

Fun for parties and weddings!
